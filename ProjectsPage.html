                <p>Description: The oldest of the projects made. The last project of my Sphomore year.
                   The pomodoro timer is a method to increase focus on a certain task by concentrating 
                   all of one's effort towards it in twenty minute bursts followed by five minue rest 
                   periods. This project is what introduced me to the .time library and remains a very 
                   important mark on my journey to becoming a programmer. At the time, this was the 
                   most difficult project for me to complete, requiring logical understandings I hadnt 
                   previously possessed. Now, as shown by the other three projects, my understanding 
                   of my work has grown leaps and bounds. The Pomodoro Timer may be less complex than 
                   the other projects, but It shows progression over time.

                <p>Description: The first project of my Junor year and the first project 
                   where I implemented Object Oriented Programing. The program works to make
                   a simulation of the card game war. Classes are used to create personalized 
                   decks for the players as well as the card identities themselves. overall, 
                   I think this was one of the most enjoyable projects to create since it had 
                   a straightforward premise which allowed most of the guesswork to be removed.

                <p>Description: One of my personal favorites which exanded my understanding of 
                   Object Oriented Programming. In this program, the computer generates three 
                   RPG characters, each with unique statistics, and runs through a series of 
                   ten battles, each with increasing difficulty. Whenever the group of characters 
                   are defeated, the fight begins again When every battle is completed with each 
                   character becoming stronger than they were previously. When each battle is won, the 
                   program prints the average amount of defeats per battle accross the entire campaign. 
                   This is one of my personal favorites because of the sheer amount of work I had to 
                   put into programing each part correctly. During this time there were still some parts 
                   of Object Orriented Programing that I still did not fully understand, but this project 
                   certainly aided my learning. This project probubly helped strengthen my understanding 
                   of programming more than any other on this list.

                <p>Description: My latest project, made at the end of my Junior year, which brings 
                   everything I learned over the course of three years and put it all together. In 
                   this project the program simulates an interactive game of Blackjack. On top of 
                   that there is a betting system implemented which starts the player with 100 credits 
                   and then ends the program when the player's bank reachs 0. While it may not be my 
                   absolute favorite on this list, it was my first true independant project where I 
                   came up with the premise and logistics all on my own. It is as of now my most 
                   complex program and shows just how far I have come over the course of four years.
