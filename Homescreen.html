            <p>I've been a student of the Fern Creek Computer Science Acadamy 
               since I began High School, and have studied Python for just 
               over two years of high school. Over that time I have only 
               increased my love for knowledge. I am always searching to learn 
               about virtually any topic and even take to doing my own personalized 
               reasearch whenever I'm currious about a certain topic. I believe 
               that every piece of knowledge will eventually become useful, so it's 
               always best to learn it. It is this love for learning which has 
               propelled me through life with zeal and has been the reason for many 
               of my acomplishments. For instance, I am also the author of a book 
               series known as Haven's Helix. Now, I have multiple projects which I 
               believe showcase my journey as a programmer. I hope that they offer 
               some insight on my personal work ethic and handling of the programming 
               language known as Python.
